# ðŸ‘‹ Hi there, I'm Harshini!

I'm a passionate Machine Learning and Deep Learning developer. I enjoy exploring state-of-the-art technologies in **NLP**, **Computer Vision**, and Generative AI, and I love collaborating on exciting, real-world AI projects.

## ðŸ”§ Technical Skills

- **Languages:** Python, C/C ++, SQL
- **ML/DL Frameworks:** PyTorch, TensorFlow, scikit-learn,Maths and Optimization.
- **Data Engineering:** PySpark, Apache Kafka
- **Dev Tools:** Git, GitHub, Jupyter Notebook, Google Collab, VS Code, Streamlit and PySpark.


## ðŸŒŸ Featured Projects

1. **Detecting bullying Tweets using LSTM & BERT**
   - Developed a cyberbullying detection model using Naive Bayes, LSTM with Attention, and BERT, categorizing tweets by themes like religion, age, race, and gender.
   - Achieved high accuracy with BERT, significantly outperforming LSTM, reaching around 95% accuracy and F1 scores above 95%.

2.  **Detect Fake Tasks using CGAN**
       - Developed a two-level classification approach using a Discriminator to filter fake data in mobile crowdsourcing, followed by AdaBoost and Random Forest to classify real tasks accurately.
       - Improved model performance significantly by removing fake data, restoring AdaBoost and Random Forest accuracies to near-original levels (0.926 and 0.993, respectively).

3.  **Lottery Ticket Hypothesis**  
       - Implemented the Lottery Ticket Hypothesis to identify sparse, trainable subnetworks within dense neural networks that can achieve similar accuracy independently.
       - Using iterative pruning, these "winning ticket" subnetworks were able to retain high accuracy while reducing the model to only 10-20% of its original size, enabling efficient training and storage.
